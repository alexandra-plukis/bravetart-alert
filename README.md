# bravetart-alert
## a baked good lover's script
I love Stella Parks's recipes, and I want to know when they go up! With this scraper, I'm notified of any new bravetart recipes on Serious Eats. 

### this project utilizes:
```
python
BeautifulSoup
requests
```

### how can you use this?
1. Do you have python downloaded? If you do, you're ready to go. If you don't, go do that.
2. Navigate to this repo, and run `python stella_parks_alert.py`, and enjoy the results.
    - `previous_title.txt` should contain the most recent title from when **I've** run the script. If it's been a minute, then it'll be a very out of date recipe--that shouldn't matter! 
3. That is truly it.
